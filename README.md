## 🎯 Motivation

Suki is primarily a **learning project** born from a love. And some passion for **C++**, **graphics programming**, and **game development**. Not really it was created to impress a specific someone...

It exists to:  
- Explore modern C++ and engine design patterns  
- Experiment with graphics, rendering, and input systems  
- Build games **with my loved one**, creating shared experiences and memories  
- Provide a fun, modular platform to prototype ideas quickly  

Every line of code in Suki is written **with passion**, combining technical learning and personal inspiration.

## 🚀 Features

- **Cross-platform windowing** with **GLFW** – works on **Windows, Linux, macOS**  
- **OpenGL context management** via **GLAD** – smooth graphics setup  
- **Logging** powered by **spdlog** – track your engine’s heartbeat  
- **Modular architecture** – swap in/out platforms or rendering backends with ease  
- **Extendable** – easily add new features or tools without hacking the core

## 📚 Learning & Experimenting

Suki isn’t just an engine—it’s a **learning companion**.  
- Dive into **renderer code** to see OpenGL in action  
- Play with **input systems** and window events  
- Add a **new module** and see how easy it is to extend
